[Warbots.io](https://warbots.io) is an **open source programming game** where the goal is to **program (using TypeScript Language)** a combat bot to compete against other robots in a battle arenas. The player is the programmer of the bot, who will have no direct influence on the game. Instead, the player must write the AI of the bot telling it how to behave and react on events occurring in the battle arena.

The game is designed to help you learn Programming, and have fun doing it. Bots are written in the TypeScript Programming Language, and the Warbot games run on web.

Warbot's battles take place in a battlefields called stages, where combat bots fight it out until only one is left. Please notice that Warbots contains no gore, no blood, no people, and no politics. The battles are simply for the excitement of competition that we love so much.

Initiative
----------

Warbots is not designed as a gamified way to learn to program but rather a full programming game where the gameplay is mainly focused during the coding / debugging phase. Through the game we guide players from zero coding experience to their first bot, involving them with all the tools necessary for them to become proficient developers. Bots are developed using TypeScript (an object oriented super set of Javascript). Among the topics covered and needed in the game we help with:

- [Git](https://github.com) for version control system
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for programming language
