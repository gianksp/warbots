#What is Warbots?

(Warbots.io)[https://warbots.io] is a programming game where the goal is to assemble and code the cpu of a combat bot to compete against other robots in a battle arenas and player vs environment scenarios . The player is the programmer of the bot, who will have no direct influence on the game. Instead, the player must write the AI of the bot telling it how to behave and react on events occurring in the battle arena.
The game is designed to help you learn Javascript, and have fun doing it. Bots are written in the Javascript Programming Language, and the Warbots game runs on web.
Warbot's battles take place in a battlefield, where combat bots fight it out until only one is left. Please notice that Warbots contains no gore, no blood, no people, and no politics. The battles are simply for the excitement of competition that we love so much. There are explosions, however, but these can be turned off if they are offending. :-)
