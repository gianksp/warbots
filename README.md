[Warbots.io](https://warbots.io) is an **open source programming game** where the goal is to **program the logic** of a combat robot (using any Programming Language) to complete challenges or battle other bots in 3D simulations. The player is the programmer of the bot, who will be able to control the bot actions by running a bot program.

Warbot's battles take place in a battlefields called stages, where bots are faced with navigational and combat challenges both single and multiplayer (vs / coop).

How It Works
------------

- Open the [web simulator](https://app.warbots.io)
- Take a note of the ***link id*** that is generated for your session
- Follow the link to download the python bot sample template or use your own
- Run your project using the ***link id*** reference from above

```bash
# Example python template
pip install requirements.txt
python run bot.py -l {link_id}
```

Initiative
----------

Warbots is a programming game where the gameplay is mainly focused during the coding / debugging phase of your Bot. Tutorials and guides will be added through the game to guide players from zero coding experience on their first bot, get them involved with all the tools necessary for them to become proficient developers. There is an SDK available for python as well as a sample bot. Among the topics covered and needed in the game we help with:

- [Git](https://github.com) for version control system
- [Python](https://www.learnpython.org/) for programming language

Game Genre/Category

Development
----------

The bots can be programmed using any language but will require the integration with AWS Cognito and Authentication. I will be providing guides for this. To start, there will be available a Python SDK and a Bot file for players to start.

Please be patient with the development.
